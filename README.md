Task 1
– Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset, focusing on creating visualizations to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this task is world_population_dataset, which contains records of the total population of various countries from 2001 to 2022.

🧰 Tools and Libraries Used
1.Pandas
2.NumPy
3.Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:
1.Data Cleaning
2.Checked for missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers
3.Handled data inconsistencies for accurate analysis
4.Data Visualization
5.Created bar charts and stacked bar charts to visualize the distribution of selected variables (e.g., total population by year or country)
6.Used visual tools to uncover patterns and trends over time

✅ Conclusion
This EDA process provided meaningful insights into the population distribution trends captured in the dataset. It serves as a solid foundation for deeper analysis and future modeling in the data science pipeline.

🙏 Thank You
Thank you for reviewing my submission! I look forward to learning and growing further during this internship experience with Prodigy Infotech.
